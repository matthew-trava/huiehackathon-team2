Notes:

# Service level affect 
## Paid Staff
from the table with paid staff vs service delivery, a significant percentage of small orgs with (no paid staff and 1 - 5 staff)ã€€had to make substantial cuts in 2020. However, a substantial number of orgs with 21+ paid staff was able to provide the same level of service. This suggests that smaller organisations and their target audience were disproportionaly affected
	- contingency table for the whole table shows dependency. didn't check those categories specifically but eyeballing the counts seem decent
- For a majority of orgs, the level of service in 2021 remain the same. This is alright for orgs with that did not have to cut services in 2020 but not ideal for those who did have to. Notably, orgs with no paid staff did not seem to have much of a bounce back. Data is a bit sparser in the 2021 data beyond the 1-5 staff bucket though.

## Volunteers
- Substantial cuts much more evenly distributed in all volunteer count buckets => not a predictor in Covid affect

## Income
- Both tables vs service delivery affect are signifant
- Don't think we can tell much from the 2021 table, but the substantial cuts for under $125k is striking

## Ethnicity
- Samoan and Tongan vs all service delivery affect are significant. Tongan/Is Tongan vs Substantial cuts/not substantial cuts is not though, so hard to say racial difference is significant

## Service type
- There are many smaller categories that may be skewing the heat map a bit
- Eyeballing the heatmap and the value counts, culture, disability services, environment, faith-based are probably hit harder than community services, health, education, family services, grant making and maybe sports.
- I think I am mentally attributing an exponential weight to the categorical affects

# Funding resources
- In 2020, orgs with no paid staff in particular have less funding reserve levels (t test for funding reserve months is significant for no paid staff vs any paid staff)
- Orgs were able to increase their funding reserve across the board (t test for 2020 vs 2021 is significant for funding reserve months)
- For orgs with no paid staff, 1-5 staff, 6-10 staff and 50+ staff, they were able to increase their funding reserves from 2020 to 2021 (t test for 2020 vs 2021 within each category). There just was not enough data to tell for the other two buckets
- Didn't look at the other categories. Don't think they will be interesting
