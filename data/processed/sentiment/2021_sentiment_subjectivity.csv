They have them off lead, and their idea of taking the dog for a walk is to take it for a shit on the footpath. Some dog owners do not stop their dogs barking all day. Wellington City Council MUST prosecute dog owners with dogs off lead or alternatively provide much larger off-lead romping areas for dogs. Dogs and their owners are out of control and this is a national issue, not a local one. 2) There are limited places to walk recreationally in our community. (Council are addressing this). As we are a small green community, lots of strangers came walking in our streets which created anxiety for some, including the dog owners whose dogs growled and barked at them. We know our locals and have a culture of questioning strangers. There were so many people walking it got congested. With the new track due to open this year, the problem will be that the dog owners will take over and the recreational walk will become fouled with dog faeces. In UK, they have banned dogs in some public parks due to the health issues caused by dog faeces. I think the time has come for Council to reconsider dogs as pets, especially in cities where the sections are now very small. ",0.025204274891774906,Neutral,0.4617126623376623,More Objective
