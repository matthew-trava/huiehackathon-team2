Charities Services and Community Net, and other organisations, have some good resources but I have found they lack some of the key things we've been looking for at this time. Also advocacy. I have felt during COVID that charities have been left behind in a lot of things - we weren't sure at first whether the wage subsidy would cover us, a lot of support has been for small businesses (which is great) but charities aren't eligible. When I've looked at other countries' responses, support for charities seems to be more wide-ranging - government and other funders simply using criteria of if your services have been impacted or if your funding has been reduced due to COVID you can apply, and you can apply for overheads/salaries not just project costs. I know some funders have done this here but for the most part we have found the funding routes for us are the same, there aren't any new routes that have opened or widened to allow us to apply.
