When I've looked at other countries' responses, support for charities seems to be more wide-ranging - government and other funders simply using criteria of if your services have been impacted or if your funding has been reduced due to COVID you can apply, and you can apply for overheads/salaries not just project costs.

Lastly duplication of objectives by one community group with the other same community group but encourage by working together and proceed with unity among the community with the same Ethnic members. Example, a group of Ethnic community doing one festival can be joined by other same Ethnic Group.
