0,"Under funding of community services is endemic. There is no slack in the system and NZer’s attitude of provision of service on the ""smell of an oily rag"" has shown when a global event like Covid hits, it hits hard and there is a limit to how quickly or effectively our organisations can pivot as we are service-based not production facilities and did not have a lot of money in the first instance. Expecting volunteer Governance to have the necessary skills to be able to lead in these sorts of emergencies is folly. The mental strain is huge and the amount of work just to keep our heads afloat is leading to burnout and depression and a loss of staff who are looking for job security. Money is the panacea but access to it is extremely limited.",disapproval,0.9141507148742676

3,"I believe it is a concern that the government relies so much on the volunteer sector in general as it is becoming increasingly harder to find and maintain volunteers who can commit to hours and long-term volunteering. Many of our volunteers are people who are on benefits and are pressured to find paid work while on Job Seekers. We train people up and then often lose them to paid work. Also, many small, local, community-based organisations who provide essential services, struggle for recognition and continued funding, especially to pay staff. ",approval,0.39017343521118164

People trying to catch up on the lost time, the work, from last year. Including we suspect but don't have definitive information on, the people within some of the institutions we deal with e.g., local govt and schools. Mid-winter we have had a number of natural crises to deal with. Feeling a bit cold and water logged down here! But still worried about the dry to come.

Some orgs have a complex layer of need, that they won't have the capacity to fill out these surveys or navigate the funding game. Others will do this well. I.e., How is current funding distributed in our sector?

24,"Suspect that with Covid money coming to an end this year that results may be slightly skewed from this survey. In some areas there is way more money floating now e.g., Food security, community resilience/response......that might not be there next year. Important to ask about reasons for increases/decreases in funding levels organisations have experienced as I suspect for many organisations there will be very DIFFERENT drivers e.g. For us it's been that we couldn't do some of our fee-paying workshops (loss of enterprise earnings) and for others, grant levels have been reduced as Councils have less money. Good to also tease apart what kind of relationships are improving and how they're changing e.g. With councils, with other community organisations, with govt agencies - are there any differences people are noticing??",curiosity,0.9783740043640137
25,"There are many, many very tired, stretched Chief Executives of charities. Even more than a year on from COVID, I'm continuing to see this whenever I'm speaking with charity CES. It's quite frankly not sustainable nor should it be. We need significant support for wellbeing of charity CES. They cannot keep delivering over and above what their communities need under such limited resourcing. At the very least, we need to see funding provided for basic infrastructure needs - salaries and overheads - on any project or service delivery. This will at least enable a level of sustainability for smaller charities and take pressure off CES. We then need personal wellbeing support for CES from boards and funders (some of the grants covering governance training could be redirected here).",desire,0.7530729174613953

What we have lost, as a social change movement, is some momentum in growth as we were just beginning to grow when Covid hit. So, it feels like we have just been treading water since. That momentum took a lot of effort to build and is difficult to kick start especially with the cloud of possible future outbreaks hanging over us.
