Having said that Covid has done a lot of positive things for us too, in terms of funding, the availability of new mental health resources, the use of technology in new ways to bring people together.

Wellington City Council MUST prosecute dog owners with dogs off lead or alternatively provide much larger off-lead romping areas for dogs. Dogs and their owners are out of control and this is a national issue, not a local one. 2) There are limited places to walk recreationally in our community. (Council are addressing this). As we are a small green community, lots of strangers came walking in our streets which created anxiety for some, including the dog owners whose dogs growled and barked at them. We know our locals and have a culture of questioning strangers. There were so many people walking it got congested. With the new track due to open this year, the problem will be that the dog owners will take over and the recreational walk will become fouled with dog faeces.

188,"I resigned during this period as it was too exhausting and hard to try to reboot what we had built up and others arrived who had different goals, I guess. They weren't really wanting to look at the impact Covid had made and how to build a new strategy.",disappointment,0.9220799803733826

190,Being a close-knit organisation from the very start helped us band together and form a contingency plan on short notice when NZ went into lockdown.

191,"As a community centre we have been faced with a significant decline in revenue due to lockdown and alert levels. This has impacted particularly on our ECE with families leaving/not returning and taking their children out of care. This has shown there isn't much slack in the system and as we don't have reserves to fall back on, there is a very real risk the organisation may fold.",sadness,0.5658232569694519
192,"Our Organisation has had an Autocratic leader who burnt out due to not sharing jobs with other members of an elected committee. A new committee was elected but all the work fell on one person to hold the Organisation together. However strong leadership skills from that person, are being utilised to bring about a shared workload strategy. ",neutral,0.7270210981369019

I still cannot take a long break, as people are still nervous, and stress in the work place is high due to the increased work load. When I take a long weekend, I come back to panic mode - 'Mums away, what do we do' mode. I struggle to teach them it’s okay now.",approval,0.4507828950881958
194,People were burnt out at end of 2020 tired and more defensive. They looked forward to holidays and easing into 2021. The reality they hit the ground running and it hasn't stopped. They are now as tired as they would be at the end of the year. There is more tension in work place relationships,realization,0.8681191205978394

The impacts of pandemic are 2-3 years for most not-for-profit groups and whilst we are aware the govt can't print money forever, the crunch time is this next 18 months, almost as bad as previous 12 months. Don't mean to sound like a whing but small organisations are closer to the wall than many realise and this impacts hugely on community wellbeing.",realization,0.9949585795402527

202,"Due to the commitment and support of our organisation as an employer, staff have been protected personally from the worst of the pandemic. However, the stress of working with our members over this period has been very high amongst all our staff due to some very bad employers, especially around the supply of PPE and paying workers the bare minimum. Even with all the Government did, a number of our members suffered great financial hardship and a loss of leave. This was really hard for us to deal with on a daily basis.
