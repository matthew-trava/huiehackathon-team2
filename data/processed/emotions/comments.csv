I have felt during COVID that charities have been left behind in a lot of things - we weren't sure at first whether the wage subsidy would cover us, a lot of support has been for small businesses (which is great) but charities aren't eligible. When I've looked at other countries' responses, support for charities seems to be more wide-ranging - government and other funders simply using criteria of if your services have been impacted or if your funding has been reduced due to COVID you can apply, and you can apply for overheads/salaries not just project costs. I know some funders have done this here but for the most part we have found the funding routes for us are the same, there aren't any new routes that have opened or widened to allow us to apply.

Arts funding is one of the most important functions and duties of our society. It is through the arts where we grow, where we reach understanding, and where we find common ground in a rapidly changing complex world. Artistic imagination and creativity are not added bonuses for society, they’re not the icing on the cake, they are integral to the human spirit and to human aspirations – an essential part of what makes us human.
