Wellington City Council MUST prosecute dog owners with dogs off lead or alternatively provide much larger off-lead romping areas for dogs. Dogs and their owners are out of control and this is a national issue, not a local one. 2) There are limited places to walk recreationally in our community. (Council are addressing this). As we are a small green community, lots of strangers came walking in our streets which created anxiety for some, including the dog owners whose dogs growled and barked at them. We know our locals and have a culture of questioning strangers. There were so many people walking it got congested. With the new track due to open this year, the problem will be that the dog owners will take over and the recreational walk will become fouled with dog faeces.

Important to ask about reasons for increases/decreases in funding levels organisations have experienced as I suspect for many organisations there will be very DIFFERENT drivers e.g. For us it's been that we couldn't do some of our fee-paying workshops (loss of enterprise earnings) and for others, grant levels have been reduced as Councils have less money.

We need significant support for wellbeing of charity CES. They cannot keep delivering over and above what their communities need under such limited resourcing. At the very least, we need to see funding provided for basic infrastructure needs - salaries and overheads - on any project or service delivery. This will at least enable a level of sustainability for smaller charities and take pressure off CES.
