Our Manager has been running the organisation for 4 years in a voluntary capacity and works 40+ hours per week and also has a health condition that has an impact on her overall wellbeing and stress levels. ","I believe it is a concern that the government relies so much on the volunteer sector in general as it is becoming increasingly harder to find and maintain volunteers who can commit to hours and long-term volunteering. Many of our volunteers are people who are on benefits and are pressured to find paid work while on Job Seekers. We train people up and then often lose them to paid work.

We were able to provide this by working with the local community centre, some food, local coms. The group is still going strong today. ","Some of the stress included trying to be flexible as an organisation (i.e., Ensure staff could work from home etc) but also trying to ensure that we were still fulfilling our obligations to community. In moments like COVID you realise that you and your staff are also community, and families themselves, so they have emotional and financial needs that need securing. The move to do more zoom was a pro and con. Pro in that we could have some great hui and keep things moving, con in that some hui can now go back-to-back. Doing more sometimes means we are thinking and looking after ourselves less. Finding that right balance is very important.","I believe that transparency in the sector is key, yes COVID had an impact on our sector, but did it have equal impact? Some orgs have a complex layer of need, that they won't have the capacity to fill out these surveys or navigate the funding game. Others will do this well. I.e., How is current funding distributed in our sector? Some of this info will be very useful, and if done regularly it would already paint a clear picture as to who might be struggling vs who is doing ok vs who is doing really well.",I agree to the inclusion of my responses

We lost a couple of part time staff who need full time jobs to support household income but overall, morale in our team has remained high. What has been stressful is forward planning in uncertainty - many of our 2020 funded workshops were delayed until 2021, which has then impacted on our 2021 programme and next tranches of grant funding applications etc. It's meant we work/plan with a 3–4-month horizon at present rather than a 12 month one as we did previously. ","Suspect that with Covid money coming to an end this year that results may be slightly skewed from this survey. In some areas there is way more money floating now e.g., Food security, community resilience/response......that might not be there next year. Important to ask about reasons for increases/decreases in funding levels organisations have experienced as I suspect for many organisations there will be very DIFFERENT drivers e.g. For us it's been that we couldn't do some of our fee-paying workshops (loss of enterprise earnings) and for others, grant levels have been reduced as Councils have less money. Good to also tease apart what kind of relationships are improving and how they're changing e.g. With councils, with other community organisations, with govt agencies - are there any differences people are noticing??",I agree to the inclusion of my responses

We need significant support for wellbeing of charity CES. They cannot keep delivering over and above what their communities need under such limited resourcing. At the very least, we need to see funding provided for basic infrastructure needs - salaries and overheads - on any project or service delivery.

We also had no income from late March to August 2020 (2 months after level 2 ended), due to the lockdown and families restarting to use the toy library conservatively after the lockdown. The Wage Subsidy was applied for by the previous committee but our 1 employee works 6h per week therefore, not all the subsidy was used. The previous committee also did not apply for the Wage Subsidy Extension which we would have qualified for. This means that we now have very limited funds to work with until the next rounds of grants are approved and paid out from July onwards, if we are successful. In the meantime, we have been fundraising to generate some income and being financially conservative. We only have reserves to last another month. However, repaying the unused portion of the Wage Subsidy we could have kept if the Extension had been applied is going to burden us financially for the next 12 months.

For our community it was interesting there seemed to be a collective we have been there done that and its over when levels were relaxed and then Auckland went into lock down our community almost did a collective gasp and were over the top vigilant and were reluctant to move about the community as they had been. I think it wasn't until that moment that the realisation hit that this was by no way over.,"As in my other comments I am highly critical of National organisations, who entered our community with no consultation with existing groups/ organisations offering food and then getting people to sign up with their organisation. Many I have spoken to since said they just did it to get the kai that they would not be travelling to another town for services. So, it felt like a stat gathering exercise rather than provision of needed services.",I agree to the inclusion of my responses

What we have lost, as a social change movement, is some momentum in growth as we were just beginning to grow when Covid hit. So, it feels like we have just been treading water since. That momentum took a lot of effort to build and is difficult to kick start especially with the cloud of possible future outbreaks hanging over us. For our organisation and for our public, This uncertainty about the foreseeable future, and whether life will ever get back to normal, is holding us back. Energy levels remain much lower. Only the very resilient are able to thrive in the current environment. The importance of resilience has been highlighted.",I agree to the inclusion of my responses

Our financial advisor doubled their price this year (and it is still lower than others). Why are people so greedy for money from small volunteer groups who handle less than $10,000 per annum? Maybe Charities calling a meeting of treasurers and chairs for small groups who have less than $10,000 turnover to find out our issues and see if the combined group can come up with solutions.

They have them off lead, and their idea of taking the dog for a walk is to take it for a shit on the footpath. Some dog owners do not stop their dogs barking all day. Wellington City Council MUST prosecute dog owners with dogs off lead or alternatively provide much larger off-lead romping areas for dogs. Dogs and their owners are out of control and this is a national issue, not a local one. 2) There are limited places to walk recreationally in our community. (Council are addressing this). As we are a small green community, lots of strangers came walking in our streets which created anxiety for some, including the dog owners whose dogs growled and barked at them. We know our locals and have a culture of questioning strangers. There were so many people walking it got congested. With the new track due to open this year, the problem will be that the dog owners will take over and the recreational walk will become fouled with dog faeces. In UK, they have banned dogs in some public parks due to the health issues caused by dog faeces. I think the time has come for Council to reconsider dogs as pets, especially in cities where the sections are now very small. ",,I agree to the inclusion of my responses

I spent $20,000 of my own money over a 7-year period running the youth programme. I don’t regret it. It was amazing but I’d never do it the same way again. We got told over and over we weren’t a priority to fund our type of work that there was some kind of problem in our funding applications. Our area wasn’t ready for the programme in my opinion and there are limited funds available for that kind of programme. But people didn’t want to fund what we were offering - art workshops for at risk youth predominantly Māori. Probably Dingle foundation got a lot of the funding. I wasn’t the right person perhaps. I was for the youth but not for funders. There is too much competition in the youth space and not enough programmes to cover youth that need them in my opinion. But that part of my life is over now so I won’t be going back there again. Not after my experiences of how difficult it was to get funding.
